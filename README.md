Aggregate and Multi Signatures based on BGLS over Alt bn128 and BLS12-381

This library provides no security against side channel attacks. We provide no security guarantees of this implementation.

## Design
The goal of this library is to create an efficient and secure ad hoc aggregate and multi signature scheme. It supports the curves [bls12-381](https://github.com/simplespy/bls12) and [alt bn128](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/crypto/bn256). It implements hashing of arbitrary byte data to curve points, the standard BGLS scheme for aggregate signatures, and a custom multi signature scheme. Further documentation for the bgls scheme is contained [here](bgls/README.md)

## Curves
See [here](curves/README.md) for documentation on the supported curves.
## Benchmarks
The following benchmarks are from a 3.80GHz i7-7700HQ CPU with 16GB ram. The aggregate verification is utilizing parallelization for the pairing operations. The multisignature has parellilization for the two involved pairing operations, and parallelization for the pairing checks at the end. Note, all of the benchmarks need to be updated.

For reference, the pairing operation on Altbn128 (the slowest operation involved) takes ~1.9 milliseconds.
```
BenchmarkPairing-8   	    1000	   1958898 ns/op
```
and for Bls12 its:
```
BenchmarkPairGT-8               	    1000	   1539918 ns/op
```

- `Signing` ~.22 milliseconds
- `Signature verification` ~3.1 milliseconds, using two pairings.
- `Multi Signature verification` ~2 milliseconds + ~1.1 microseconds per signer, two pairings + n point additions
- `Aggregate Signature verification` ~.36 milliseconds per signer/message pair, with n+1 pairings run in parallel. (4.45x speedup with 8 cores)

The following benchmarks are done with altbn128, before the product of pairings
abstraction was included. These need to be updated.
```
$ go test github.com/Project-Arda/bgls/bgls/  -v -bench .

```
For comparison, the ed25519 implementation in go yields much faster key generation signing and single signature verification. However, at ~145 microseconds per verification, the multi signature verification is actually faster beyond ~26 signatures.
```
$ go test golang.org/x/crypto/ed25519 -bench .

BenchmarkVerification-8    	   10000	    145063 ns/op
PASS

## Future work
- Optimize bigint allocations.
- Add hashing to G2
- Integrations with [bgls-on-evm](https://github.com/jlandrews/bgls-on-evm).
- Add tests to show that none of the functions mutate data.
- More complete usage documentation.
- Add buffering for the channels used in parallelization.
- Make upstream libraries implement [product of pairings algorithms](https://eprint.iacr.org/2006/172.pdf)
